<sup>1</sup> While these have the same model in your inventory, the Accuracy Laser part has an actual laser coming out of its model in game ([comparison](https://bl2.parts/pistols/%5Eimages/accessories/laser_comp.png)).  
<sup>2</sup>The bonuses in each pair are applied at different times of the calculation.

All accessories have set prefixes associated with them based on manufacturer, which, assuming they don’t get overwritten, are a simple way to tell which one exactly a weapon has.
