## Materials

The material parts also have no model, instead defining the actual textures applied on top of all the other models.

There are 29 non-unique material parts. Like with bodies, there’s one for each rarity-manufacturer combination. In Tina DLC, each manufacturer gets an additional gemstone material, and in TPS, Hyperion has an additional “Old Hyperion” material per rarity.

Most materials provide no stat bonuses. The exceptions are listed below.
